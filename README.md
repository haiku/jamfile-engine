Description
===========

The Jamfile engine allows developers to easily build their Haiku applications using Jam.

Jam is a non-compatible replacement for Make, which is more geared towards generic and reusable
rules and actions, and making the task of writing a build system easier.

Usage
=====

Install the jamfile_engine package on your Haiku machine.

Copy the provided Jamfile next to your sources. Edit it and fill it in as needed. Then type "jam"
to compile your application.
